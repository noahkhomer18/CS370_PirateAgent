# CS 370: Pirate Intelligent Agent Project

## 1. Briefly Explain the Work You Did on This Project
For this project, I was given starter code that included two Python files: **`TreasureMaze.py`** and **`GameExperience.py`**. These files defined the maze environment and handled the experience replay mechanism. I also received a partially completed Jupyter Notebook (**`TreasureHuntGame.ipynb`**) with placeholders and TODO sections.  
I implemented the **deep Q-learning algorithm**, designed the **neural network model**, and wrote the **training loop** to teach the pirate agent how to find the treasure. I added comments and tested the code to ensure the agent could reliably navigate the maze.

## 2. Connecting My Learning to the Larger Field of Computer Science

### **What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**
Computer scientists solve complex problems by crafting algorithms, writing software, and building intelligent systems. This is critical because software and AI now fuel innovation across healthcare, finance, gaming, and beyond. Creating intelligent agents like this pirate allows us to automate tasks, make smarter decisions, and improve user experiences.

### **How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**
I break problems into smaller components, analyze each part, and explore algorithms that best fit. For this project, I used **reinforcement learning** to determine the optimal pathfinding approach. I fine-tuned hyperparameters and reviewed the results to ensure the agent achieved its goal.

### **What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and organization?**
As a developer, I prioritize building software that is **secure, reliable, and free from harmful bias**. Protecting user data and maintaining transparency in AI decision-making is crucial. With this project, I focused on ensuring that the pirate agent behaves predictably and doesn't introduce unexpected behavior that could disrupt the game experience.
