CS 370: Pirate Intelligent Agent Project
1. Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For this project, I was given starter code that included two Python files: TreasureMaze.py and GameExperience.py. These files defined the maze environment and handled the experience replay mechanism. I also received a partially completed Jupyter Notebook (TreasureHuntGame.ipynb) with placeholders and TODO sections. I implemented the deep Q-learning algorithm in the notebook, designed the neural network model, and wrote the training loop to teach the pirate agent how to find the treasure. I added comments and tested the code to ensure the agent could reliably navigate the maze.

2. Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists tackle tough problems by crafting algorithms, writing software, and building smart systems. This is a big deal because software and AI are now fueling innovation across the board, touching everything from healthcare to even gaming. By developing things like intelligent agents, we can automate tasks, make smarter choices, and create better experiences for people.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
When I'm faced with a problem, I like break to it down into smaller, manageable more pieces. Then,  I explore different ways to solve each piece, figuring out which algorithms or models work best.  For this particular project, I used reinforcement learning to figure the out best pathfinding approach. I spent time tweaking the hyperparameters and carefully analyzing the training results to make sure the agent was successful.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
As a developer,  I feel it's really important that the software I build dependable is, secure, and doesn't have any harmful biases baked in. Protecting user data is a big deal too,  and I think it's essential to be transparent about how AI decisions makes. I always try to stick to the best industry practices when it comes to testing and making sure things are working as they should.  With this project, spent I some time thinking about how reinforcement learning agents should act in a predictable way and not do anything unexpected that could mess up the game for players.
